Implement a Stack with a Vector
In lecture we said that std::stack is a thin wrapper over a standard library sequence container like std::vector.  In this challenge, you will implement a toy stack using a std::vector.  The stack will be templated so it can contain elements of any type T.  The member functions to implement are

void push(T val) -- Add val to the top of the stack.

void pop() -- Remove the top value on the stack.

T& top() -- Return a reference to the top value on the stack.

int size() -- Return the number of elements in the stack.

bool empty() -- Return whether or not the stack is empty.

Building the stack on top of a std::vector, each of these member functions can be implemented with a single line!
