Number of unique elements
In this week's coding exercise you are given a vector of integers and you want to determine how many distinct numbers appear in the vector.  The signature of the function looks as follows:

int numberOfDistinctElements(const std::vector<int>& vec);
Let's look at some examples

if vec = {2} then the output should be 1.

if vec = {2, 2} then the output should be 1.  The only number that appears is 2.

if vec = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3} then the output should be 3 because the distinct numbers are 1, 2, 3.

if vec = {3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 5, 5} then the output should be 3 because the distinct numbers are 3, 4, 5.

Your algorithm should run in time

n.  When you press "mark" we test your function on 20 test cases, and we have set a time limit to finish running on these test cases.  You are free to include other libraries and use functions from the <algorithm> library.  As a hint, you may want to take a look at the std::unique function to see how it might help to solve this problem.

Your score for the coding challenge is purely determined by the number of test cases you pass (i.e. your score out of 100 is 5 times the number of test cases you pass).
