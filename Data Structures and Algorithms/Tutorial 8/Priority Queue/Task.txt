Priority Queue
The standard library has an implementation of a priority queue.  It is defined in the library queue.   The default setting is a max priority queue.  

#include <queue>

// create empty max priority queue of ints
std::priority_queue<int> queue {};
The main operations we can do are:

Add an element: queue.push(3)

Look at the top (i.e. max) element: queue.top()

Remove the top element: queue.pop()

In this challenge you will play with std::priority_queue and get some practice using it.  You will also see the syntax to use a std::priority_queue as a minimum priority queue, and how to use it with a user defined type.
