Min Heap
In this challenge you will implement a minimum binary heap from scratch using std::vector in a class called Heap.   This will be a toy version of a std::priority_queue.  A Heap is a templated class where the template parameter T represents the type of keys the heap stores.  The main member functions in the Heap class are

void push(const T& key); to add a key to the heap.

void pop(); to remove the top element.

const T& top() const; to view the top (minimum) element.

int size() const; returns the number of elements in the heap.

bool empty() const; returns whether or not there are any elements in the heap.

There are also two private member functions swim and sink.  These are helper functions to implement push and pop, respectively, as described in lecture.
